Since `score-compose` version `0.27.0` and `score-k8s` version `0.4.0`, as Platform Engineers you can patch the default Workload manifests generated by `score-compose|k8s generate`.

This repository is a library of patch templates examples that you can use with either `score-compose` or `score-k8s`.

## For `score-compose`

- `unprivileged.tpl`

Example of usage:
```bash
score-compose init \
    --no-sample \
    --patch-templates https://raw.githubusercontent.com/score-spec/community-patchers/refs/heads/main/score-compose/service-account.tpl \
```

## For `score-k8s`

- `service-account.tpl`
- `statefulset.tpl`
- `unprivileged.tpl`

Example of usage:
```bash
score-k8s init \
    --no-sample \
    --patch-templates https://raw.githubusercontent.com/score-spec/community-patchers/refs/heads/main/score-k8s/unprivileged.tpl \
    --patch-templates https://raw.githubusercontent.com/score-spec/community-patchers/refs/heads/main/score-k8s/service-account.tpl
```
